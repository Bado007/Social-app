# Social App

## **Introduction**
Social App is an informative app on which users can like, view, edit and download posts.  Social App also has a log-in and sign-up option. It is a project which combines a user-friendly interface on the front end and also the functionality on the back end.

App is made for educational purposes with guidance from [Code Institute](https://codeinstitute.net) facilitators. Its core purpose is to apply new learnings and implement them in a practical example.

## Testing

Testing was not performed yet. For now, is being on hold while waiting for the assessment results from [Code Institute's](https://codeinstitute.net) facilitators. It is being placed on my roadmap, to ensure the application's perfect capability. 



## Bugs

During the coding, I encountered few bugs:


-  Typos (missing **colons, semicolons**)
-  Code formating (unsufficient spaces)
-  Deployment issues (unable to deploy to Heroku)
-  Rendering issues (due to typos and wrong syntax)
-  Styles not being loaded (due to DEBUG turned TRUE in 'setting . py')
-  Unable to create screenshot of the application on the [Am I responsive](https://ui.dev/amiresponsive?url=https://blogman-2022.herokuapp.com/admin/blog/post/) website.
-  Deployment failed
 
> Disclaimer! There are few lines of code in the project that exceed 79 characters.

Otherwise **Code passed** [PEP8](http://pep8online.com/)  validation. 



## Deployment

This project is deployed by [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/home).

Steps I took for deployment:

-   Use [Code Institute's](https://www.codeinstitute.net) template.
-   Create new Heroku app.
-   Assign **Convig Vars** both in Heroku and in the Blogman. app
-   Set buildbacks to Python and NodeJs in that order.
-  Set **DEBUG** value (settings. py) to *FALSE*! 
-   Link the Heroku app to this repository.
-  Remove Local Database **Config Vars** in Heroku app.
-   Click on Deploy.


## Roadmap

 - [ ] Python Testing
